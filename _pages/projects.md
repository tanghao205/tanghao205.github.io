Life is data. 
Here the machine learning is going to tell the wine's story by doing testers' job. 

I used two popular ML mothods, ***Random Forest*** and ***Boosting*** to build the regression model on the wine score with the data from **Winemag**. 

By recommanding the Pinot Noir from outstanding winery, we can also see testers' preference or inclination.

# Skin Cancer Diagnosis Learning

Skin cancer, as the abnormal growth of skin cell, is one of the most common cancer in the US. The curing effect to
it is based on detection in the early stage.  

This machine learning project is to verify the detection methods according to skin cancer lesion area with different learning models.  

The first part of the project is to fit three classifiers on the diagnosis image pixel, and analyze the prediction result after PCA transform. Below are the learning mothods:   

- **K-Nearest-Neighbors**
- **Support Vector Machine**
- **Random Forest**

{% include gallery id="skin_cancer" layout="three" %}  

The second part is to extract visible features from the images after effective image processing (*applying knn in skin area recognition*), then fit classifiers based on our new features, which will be more interpretable to skin cancer diagnosis. Here is the learning methods:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**

*Normal detection rate from dermatologist is 54%*  
*Models on the 1st section sucessfully detect ~75% skin cancer*.  
*Models on the 2nd section sucessfully detect ~70% skin cancer*.
